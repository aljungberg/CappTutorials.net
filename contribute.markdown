### How to contribute

Anyone can add new tutorials to this site! Just fork the site on [github](https://github.com/natemartinsf/CappTutorials.net), add an article, and send a pull request.

All articles are stored in markdown format. Take a look at other articles to see how to set categories, etc.

Categories are manually ordered on the index page. If you add a new category, edit the index and the "index" method in renderers.js to add the category.

We welcome any other contributions as well! If you want to change how the site behaves, or even redesign the site, feel free to fork and modify!

Want to write a tutorial, but stumped on a topic? Here's some tutorials that would be a fantastic addition:

*	Getting started with Cappuccino on Linux or Windows
*	Deploying your Cappuccino app
*	Connecting to backends (Seperate articles for Rails and Node.js?)
*	Using Core Animation
*	User Authentication
*	Custom Table Views
*	Introduction to Bindings
